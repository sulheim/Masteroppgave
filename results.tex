\section{Results}
This chapter is divided in three parts. The first part deal with qualitative results. This include response to high power ultrasound, intensity growth curves, and phase-shift bubble behavior. The second part provides a quantitative validation of the counting algorithm. This validation is based on the randomly synthesized data set. The last part present the results from processing and counting of the real data set.

\section{Counting of 16 animals}
Counted number of bubbles for the 16 animals is presented together with the manually counted result in Figure \ref{Fig:Number of counted bubbles} and \ref{Fig:Number density of counted bubbles}. The bubble count representing each animal is the highest, reliable count during the video of administration of compound. A full list of counted bubbles, and frame number for counting is presented in Appendix (EXCEL ark).
There may be small differences between the ROI used for the automatic and manually counted data. This affect the number of counted bubbles, N.

\end{figure}

For all 16 animals, time-intensity curves showing the integrated intensity within the ROI as a function of time is plotted. The count number density is also plotted with respect to time. For animal 1, this is presented in Figure 1 and 2. For all other animals, this is found in Appendix?????.
