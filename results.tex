\section{Results}
This chapter is divided in three parts. The first part deal with qualitative results. This include response to high power ultrasound, intensity growth curves, and phase-shift bubble behaviour. The second part provides a quantitative validation of the counting algorithm. This validation is based on the randomly synthesized data set. The last part present the results from processing and counting of the real data set. 
 
\subsection{Qualitative results}
This section provides qualitative results, following the prejudices stated in Section \ref{sec:qualitative}.
\subsubsection{Effect of high power ultrasound}

Counted number of bubbles before and after 2 high ultrasound bursts in non-linear and linear imaging mode were available for 8 and 13 animals, respectively. Relative change after two flash pulses is shown in Figure \ref{High power US non-lin} and \ref{High power US non-lin}. Note that the high power US burst are extended (\SI{\sim 2}{\second}) in non-linear mode, while they are extremely short in linear mode (less than \SI{0.1}{\second}). Single bubble intensity curves subject to two short flashes in linear imaging mode are shown in Figure \ref{Fig:high_power_US}.

\subsubsection{Kinetics}
Bubble kinetics are shown in Figure \ref{Fig:bubble_kinetic}. A specific event where a phase-shift bubble is released from its current location, and relocated is marked in image with a yellow circle, and occurs 36 seconds into the corresponding video.

The phase-shift bubble dynamics are also visible in \ref{bubble_zoom}, where we see inflow and activation of a single phase-shift bubble.

\subsection{Counting of synthesized data}
The synthesized data is based on three different background movies. Results and non-linear regression is shown for each individual background in Figure \ref{Fig:counted_vs_inserted1}, \ref{Fig:counted_vs_inserted2} and \ref{Fig:counted_vs_inserted3}. The entire set, composed of all data from the three background, is presented in Figure \ref{Fig:counted_vs_inserted_all} and \ref{Fig:counted_vs_inserted_all_small}.

\end{figure}

If we swap the axes, we can plot the actual number density as a function of counted number density. We only consider the near-linear range, see Figure \ref{Fig:counted_vs_inserted_inverse}.

\subsection{Counting of real data}
Bubbles for the 16 animals is presented together with the manually counted result in Figure \ref{Fig:Number of counted bubbles} and \ref{Fig:Number density of counted bubbles}. The bubble count representing each animal is the highest, count during the video of administration of compound. A full list of counted bubbles, and frame number for counting is presented in Appendix (EXCEL ark). Counting of administration of ACT\texttrademark is seen in Figure \ref{Fig:counting_administration}. All contrast agent is colored in green. The blue boundary defines the region of interest, and counting is only performed within this area. Areas which are identified as stuck phase-shift bubbles are circumscribed with red.

There may be small differences between the ROI used for the automatic and manually counted data. This affect the number of counted bubbles, N.

  \caption{Number density of counted, stuck phase-shift bubbles of the 16 mice. Automatic counting is shown in red, while manual counting in blue.}
  \label{Fig:Number density of counted bubbles}
\end{figure}

For all 16 animals, time-intensity curves showing the integrated intensity within the ROI as a function of time is plotted. The count number density is also plotted with respect to time. For  one animal, this is presented in Figure \ref{Fig:tic} and \ref{Fig:tic_count}. For all animals, this is found in Appendix?????.
