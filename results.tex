\section{Results}
This chapter is divided in three parts. The first part deals with the qualitative results. This includes response to high power ultrasound, intensity growth curves, and phase-shift bubble behaviour. The second part provides a quantitative validation of the counting algorithm. This validation is based upon the randomly synthesized data set. The last part presents the results from the processing and counting of the real data set. 
 
\subsection{Qualitative results}
This section provides qualitative results, following the prejudices stated in Section \ref{sec:qualitative}.
\subsubsection{Effect of high power ultrasound}

The counted number of bubbles before and after two high ultrasound bursts in non-linear and linear imaging mode were available for 8 and 13 animals, respectively. Relative change after two flash pulses is shown in Figure \ref{High power US non-lin} and \ref{High power US lin}. Note that the high power ultrasound burst are extended (\SI{\sim 2}{\second}) in non-linear mode, while they are extremely short in linear mode (less than \SI{0.1}{\second}). Single bubble intensity curves subject to two short flashes in linear imaging mode are shown in Figure \ref{Fig:high_power_US}.

\subsubsection{Kinetics}
Bubble kinetics are shown in Figure \ref{Fig:bubble_kinetic}. A specific event occur in the location marked by the yellow circle 36 seconds into the corresponding video. A phase-shift bubble is released from its current location and relocated.

The phase-shift bubble dynamics are also visible in Figure \ref{bubble_zoom} and \ref{bubble_zoom_tic}, where we see inflow and activation of a single phase-shift bubble.

\subsection{Counting of synthesized data}
The synthesized data is based on three different background videos. The three data sets and respective non-linear best fit are found in Figure \ref{close comoarison}. The data is log-transformed and fitted to a third degree polynomial. The curve fitting is performed on the log-transformed data because of the multiplicative nature of speckle noise. A logarithmic transformation converts multiplication to addition, and makes the noise almost normally distributed (Figure \ref{Fig:log_normal}). The entire set, composed of all data from the three backgrounds, is presented in Figure \ref{Fig:counted_vs_inserted_all} and \ref{Fig:counted_vs_inserted_all_small}.
\begin{figure}[h]

If we swap the axes, we can plot the actual number density as a function of the counted number density. If we only consider the near-linear range, we can fit a linear curve to the log-transformed data (Figure \ref{Fig:counted_vs_inserted_inverse}). The spread of the counted number density has been evaluated (Figure \ref{Fig:rsd}). The average relative standard deviation is 0.016.

\subsection{Counting of real data}
Counted number density for the 16 animals are presented together with the manually counted results (Figure \ref{Fig:Number of counted bubbles} and \ref{Fig:Number density of counted bubbles}). The bubble count representing each animal is the maximum count during the video of ACT\texttrademark{} injection. Results for all 125 video sequences are found in Appendix (\ref{raw counting}). Image of counting during ACT\texttrademark{} administration is found in Figure \ref{Fig:counting_administration}. The contrast agent is coloured in green. The blue boundary defines the region of interest, and counting is only performed within this area. Areas which are identified as stuck phase-shift bubbles are circumscribed with red.

The blue boundary defines the region of interest, and counting is only performed within this area. Areas which are identified as stuck phase-shift bubbles are circumscribed with red.}

There may be small differences between the ROI used for the automatic and manually counted data. This affects the number of counted bubbles, N.

  \caption{Number density of counted, stuck phase-shift bubbles in the 16 mice. Automatic counting is shown in red, while manual counting is shown in blue.}
  \label{Fig:Number density of counted bubbles}
\end{figure}

For all 16 animals, time-intensity curves showing the integrated intensity within the ROI as a function of time is plotted. The count number density is also plotted with respect to time. For one animal, this is presented in Figure \ref{Fig:tic} and \ref{Fig:tic_count}. Similar results for all animals are found in Appendix \ref{tic appendix} and \ref{App:number_density_curves}.
