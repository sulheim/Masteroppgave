\section{Abstract}
Ultrasound mediated drug delivery is an important tool in the fight against cancer. A new concept known  as ACT\texttrademark{} is under development, and two pilot imaging studies have been performed on prostate cancer xenografts in mice.  A large amount of raw ultrasound data has been recorded, but existing software can not perform the required image processing. The ACT\texttrademark{} concept is based on clusters of microbubbles and microdroplets which experience a phase-shift from liquid to gas when exposed to ultrasound. The phase-shift increase the bubble size and make them stick in the tumor vasculature. 

A complete program has been developed in Matlab to process the raw ultrasound data. The program is tailored to the unique properties of the phase-shift bubbles, and is able to reduce noise and motion artefacts, visualize the contrast agent, and count the number of ultrasound activated phase-shift bubbles. The program produce high quality videos displaying both free flowing contrast agent and identified, stuck phase-shift bubbles. 

The program show very good correlation with a manually counted data set. The program is also validated against a synthesized data set, and we found that the program count accurately up to \SI{\sim2}{bubbles\per\milli\meter}. When the number density increase above this threshold, the program experience a saturation and count too few bubbles.
